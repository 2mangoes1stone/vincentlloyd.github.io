<p>I am an aspiring web developer with a curious mind and a passion for ideas. I arrived on the shores of Techtopia with experience in architectural design and startup management, places in which I applied creativity to solve problems and worked collaboratively to manage project complexity and deadlines.

A great project demands a great brief but as these are sometimes hard to formulate I am happy to report that I have, in another life, helped clients to clarify their desires so that they might realise their dream. I am interested in automation and the digitisation of business operations and am a true believer in technology’s potential to improve people’s lives. The robots are coming and I, for one, intend to be their friend.</p>
